As before, we provide the `column_id` and `column_sort` parameters, but we can also provide `max_timeshift` which tells us how many time steps back (in addition to the current time step) should be considered. For example, a `max_timeshift=2` will yield windows of length 3. If the parameter is ommited, the timeseries will keep getting longer and longer as time progresses. Whether this is desirable depends largely on the problem being solved, though for long timeseries it can incurr significant resource demands."
